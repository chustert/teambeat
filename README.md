TeamBeat provides businesses with a meaningful platform that gauges employee wellbeing for the benefit of the employee and the company.

It helps companies to manage the impact of stress in their workplace and can create a culture of support between employees within the company. 
It gathers data through specifically targeted questions within surveys in the fields of work and wellbeing. This data then informs the business leadership on target areas for improvement.
